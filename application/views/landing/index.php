                <p>We all know, “The customer is not always right.”  Sometimes things go wrong, and a customer becomes challenging to deal with or refuses to pay.  Maybe they wasted your time with multiple callbacks or canceled a job without notifying you in advance.   Customer check is the opposite of Angie’s List, Yelp, or Google Reviews – now businesses can post reviews about their customers from a PC or smartphone.</p>

                <h5 class="fw-bold">AVOID BAD TENANTS WITHOUT THE HASSLE OF BACKGROUND CHECKS</h5>
                <p class="mt-3">Avoiding bad tenants can be difficult, even if you consistently run background checks and credit checks on prospective tenants. Background checks can be expensive, and not very accurate because we all know less than %5 of all eligible tenant cases actually make it to small claims court. Evictions and rent recovery can be an expensive and long process – that’s why so many of us simply kick the can down the road and hope it becomes someone else’s problem. With Customer Check, you can search and report as much as you like for a fraction of the cost. Instead of taking days to process an application, our site can give you valuable information in seconds.</p>

                <h5 class="fw-bold">BUSINESSES CAN LEGALLY POST REVIEWS</h5>
                <p class="mt-3">Have you ever wanted to post a review about a customer and tell your side of the story, but thought it was impossible or even illegal?  Now you can with Customer Check!  Our site was designed with the help of a legal team in Ames, IA to create the first site that allows businesses to post reviews legally and anonymously without violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  Our unique design protects the privacy of both the business member as well as the privacy of the reported customer.  Best of all<b> the customer never knows </b> you posted the review and your business is completely anonymous.  Search and report as often as you like without risking your business.
                    We’ve been helping businesses all over the country avoid bad customers since 2018.</p>

                <p>Your customers can write and read reviews on dozens of sites to share their experiences and make informed decisions.  As a member of Customer check, you can do the same – only in reverse.</p>
                <p>All businesses have a list of customers who they love and those they never want to do business with again, so we created a site that allows them to securely and anonymously post reviews on their customers. Since 2018 we have helped businesses across the US report and avoid bad customers without any problems. In fact, not one business has complained of being exposed. Our site is secure, private, and best of all – the customer never knows they were reviewed and because this is a private network we never have to inform them since the reviews are not for public viewing.</p>
                <p>We all want to do business with excellent customers while trying to avoid the bad ones.  Until now it was like navigating a minefield blindfolded.  Knowing who the best customers are in your neighborhood has never been easier to find!  You can safely share your experiences with other members because everything you do on our site is kept entirely confidential and anonymous.  We never share any information with anyone outside of the membership.  Ever.</p>
